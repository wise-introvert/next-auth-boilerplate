## NextJS, Prisma (MongoDB) and Next-Auth boilerplate

This template uses Google and Github as auth providers but can be easily extended to support additional providers ( Apple, BitBucket, etc ).

### Setup and run

1. Install deps using `yarn install` or just `yarn`.
2. Generate client and secret keys on Google and Github.
3. Copy content from `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the keys.
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the app in dev mode.
